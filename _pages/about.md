# About me

In January 2022 I started a Postdoc at the university of Paris Dauphine with Cl√©ment Royer. 

Prior to that:

- Ph.D. in the Applied Mathematics department at the University of Oxford. I worked with Coralia Cartis and Armin Eftekhari. My research was supported by the Alan Turing Institute. The Institute located in London is the UK's national institute for Data Science.

- Undergraduate and Master's Degree in Mathematical Engineering at UCLouvain in Belgium. I worked with Pierre-Antoine Absil, Wen Huang and Raphael Jungers. My master thesis is about "Quasi-Newton methods for nonsmooth Riemannian optimization".  

# Research interests
- Nonlinear matrix recovery
- Optimization on Riemannian manifolds
- Second-order optimization methods
