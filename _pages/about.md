Welcome to my website!

I am a researcher working in numerical optimization and applied mathematics. 
As of August 2024, I am working as a postdoctoral researcher at UCLouvain in the group of   
Pierre-Antoine Absil.

Prior to that:

- From 2022 to 2024, I was a postdoc at the university of Paris Dauphine in the group of Clément Royer.

- Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of Oxford. I was supervised by Coralia Cartis and Armin Eftekhari. My research was supported by the Alan Turing Institute. The Institute located in London is the UK's national institute for Data Science. My thesis is called "A Riemannian perspective on nonlinear matrix recovery and constrained optimization".

- Undergraduate and Master's Degree in Mathematical Engineering at UCLouvain in Belgium. I worked with Pierre-Antoine Absil, Wen Huang and Raphael Jungers. My master thesis is about "Quasi-Newton methods for nonsmooth Riemannian optimization".  

# Research interests
- Nonlinear optimization, numerical analysis
- Nonlinear matrix recovery and inverse problems
- Optimization on Riemannian manifolds
- Second-order optimization methods
