# About me

I am a Ph.D. student in the Applied Mathematics department at the University of Oxford. I am working with Coralia Cartis and Armin Eftekhari. My research is supported by the Alan Turing Institute. The Institute located in London is the UK's national institute for Data Science.

Prior to that, I got my Master's Degree in Mathematical Engineering at UCLouvain in Belgium. I worked with Pierre-Antoine Absil, Wen Huang and Raphael Jungers. My master thesis is about "Quasi-Newton methods for nonsmooth Riemannian optimization".  

# Research interests
- Nonlinear matrix recovery
- Optimization on Riemannian manifolds
- Second order optimization methods
